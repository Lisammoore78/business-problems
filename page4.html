                    1. Use alt tags.<br>
                When you hover your mouse over an image on a website,
                 the little words that pop up are called alt tags<br>
                 2. Create subtitles and transcripts<br>
                If your web content regularly includes videos, 
                try to provide subtitles — especially if you’re producing the bulk of your own video content.<br>
                3. Put periods in abbreviations.<br>
                If you're abbreviating something in HTML, put periods in between each letter. For example, 
                if you're referencing the Central Intelligence Agency,
                write it out as C.I.A., rather than CIA <br>
                4. Describe your links.<br>
                When embedding a link in a post, it's more useful to describe the link,
                 rather than just telling the reader to "click here." <br>
                 5. untilize colour control. <br>
                 Practicing smart color choices is useful for a website with any kind of audience. Avoid pairing garish colors, 
                 and be wary of using yellow, blue and green close to one another (this is especially difficult for colorblind users).
                  Black text on a white background is the best general practice,
                  because it's readable for most audiences.<br>
                  6. Get clickable.
                For users with mobility problems, it can be difficult to click on small items within a tiny clickable range.
                 It’s like trying to nail a bullseye every single time you play a game of darts. 
                 Give the clickable item a wider range so the user can click on it within the item's general area.<br>
                 7. Keep your copy simple.<br>
                 This tip is helpful for any audience, but is imperative for elderly audiences or those with learning disabilities.
                  If you're putting a lot of text onto your website, break it into smaller paragraphs.
                Use simple, straightforward language in the active voice.<br>
