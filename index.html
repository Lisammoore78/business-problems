    <p>It’s difficult to overstate the importance of information technology in today’s business climate. No matter what industry it belongs to, a business’ lifeblood in today’s economy is the information that makes it possible for it to conduct business.

        Businesses utilize IT in a number of different contexts and for many different purposes. In other words, IT isn’t just computers. For example, telephones, radio equipment and VOIP services used for vocal communications are included under the IT umbrella. In the same way, peripherals such as printers, copiers, scanners and 3D printers are also considered part of a business’ IT systems.
        
        Of course, when most people think IT, they think of computers: desktop machines, laptops and mobile devices used by individuals to input and manipulate data, create digital documents, conduct research, and more. IT also includes the applications and executable programs that are installed on these devices to enable the user to complete the task at hand. Somewhat less obviously, IT may also include the costs associated with purchasing, configuring and maintaining the necessary hardware and equipment to keep the company’s IT systems operating smoothly. In these ways, IT has become critical to the global business community.<br/><br/>

         How do copyright and other constraints affect websites?,<br/><br/> <di/>

        <p> Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish.
          The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original author,
           second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site,
           link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.
        Alternatively you can use royality free webistes which allow you to do this <br/>
        The most basic concept you must know to work with stock photos is that you are acquiring the right to use a photo in a certain way, not the property of the photo itself. 
        The photographer who created the photo is still the owner of the photo. He/she holds the copyright, the official term pointing the ownership of photos, music, paintings, texts, and other intellectual physical or non-physical creations.
